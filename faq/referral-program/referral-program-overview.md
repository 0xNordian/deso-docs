# Referral Program - Overview

The DeSo referral program allows users to share their unique referral link with a friend who has yet to join the platform.&#x20;

The DeSo Foundation rewards the [Advocate](referral-program-glossary.md) and [Friend](referral-program-glossary.md) through a dual-sided incentive program, which differs by KYC country. A full list can be found [here](referral-program-incentive-structure.md).

Users are not granted a referral link upon signup. Issuing referral links is typically done manually and in batches.

Our [referral incentives](referral-program-glossary.md) are accurate as of when the advocate sends an invite to a friend. However, our referral amounts are subject to change, so we recommend the friend signs up immediately after receiving the referral link.

After a friend verifies their identity via Jumio, the advocate will be granted the referral incentive (based on the incentive structure outlined [here](referral-program-incentive-structure.md)). A user will be prompted to verify their identity (via Jumio) after signup either with Google or a seed phrase.

Some referral links are capped to a maximum number of referred friends. This information can be viewed by logging into [Diamond](https://diamondapp.com), navigating to `Referrals`, and viewing `Referrals remaining` under `My Referrals`.

Please note, when verifying identity via Jumio, a user's wallet will automatically be funded with $DESO, which allows users to immediately interact with the blockchain (like posts, give diamonds, etc.) **This amount granted is based on a user's KYC country and is not dependent on using a referral link/code during signup**.

_The referral program incentive amounts and structure are subject to change at any time._
