# Reporting an Account or Post

* The best way to report a post or account is to do so via our “Report” buttons. This method allows us to keep a record of every public key that is reported so we can reverse search blacklisted accounts if needed.&#x20;
* You can expect your reported account or post to be reviewed 24 hours from the initial report.
* Support will no longer be reviewing any reported scams in Discord. When one-off accounts are reported in Discord, there exists no record of account removal as they don’t get entered into the excel spreadsheet that keeps track of all reported public keys.

### How do I report an account or post?&#x20;

1. **To report a post,** look for “Report Content” button after clicking on the 3 dots in the top right hand corner the post. You will be directed to a short form to complete the report.

1. **To report an account**, look for the “Report User” button on the profile to reach a short form to file a report. Add a link to the real account in the form to report an imposter account. If there’s no link, add an explanation.
