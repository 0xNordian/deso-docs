# Validating with ID

After selecting Sign up with Seed, you will be prompted to save your Seed Phrase. After proceeding, you will see a screen with the following verification options. Choose `Validate with your ID` (this is done via our third-party provider, Jumio).&#x20;

If you received a referral link to signup, validating with your ID via Jumio allows DeSo to reward the person who referred you (more [here](../../referral-program/referral-program-overview.md)).

After tapping `Validate with your ID`, a new window will be created, prompting you to start the verification process with Jumio.

Jumio's accepted forms of identification vary based on country. Please tap the information icon in the verification flow to review ID options in your KYC country.

After completing the verification flow, your [signup bonus](broken-reference) will automatically be deposited into your wallet.

If you chose an alternate method to validate your account during signup, you may later access the validating with ID flow by navigating to the [Diamond homepage](https://diamondapp.com/browse), then tapping `Click here to get your free $`.
