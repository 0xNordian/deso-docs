# Validate by buying or sending $DESO

If you choose to validate your DeSo account by buying $DESO, you will be prompted with this window during signup.

Tapping `show me how` will trigger the dialog below.

The dialog prompts you to buy $DESO with fiat via [Wyre](https://www.sendwyre.com), or send BTC or ETH to your DeSo account then convert it to $DESO. You may also simply transfer $DESO from Coinbase (or another DeSo wallet) to your wallet using your Public Key. Look for the black key icon to locate your Public Key.

If you skip adding $DESO to your account during signup, you may choose to do so later by navigating to the [Buy Deso](https://diamondapp.com/buy-deso) section of your account and following the steps outlined above.
