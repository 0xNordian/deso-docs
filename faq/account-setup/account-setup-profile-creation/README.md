It costs 0.001 DESO to create a Profile on DeSo (the USD equivalent is viewable on-chain). A user must fund their $DESO wallet in order to create a profile. Your DeSo wallet can be funded in three ways:

1. [validating-with-id.md](validating-with-id.md "mention")
   * a [Signup Bonus ](broken-reference)or [Referral Incentive](../../referral-program/referral-program-overview.md) will be deposited into your wallet
2. [validating-via-sms.md](validating-via-sms.md "mention")
   * a [Signup Bonus](broken-reference) will be deposited into your wallet
   * you can choose to validate with ID from the homepage if you choose to proceed with this method
3. [validate-by-buying-or-sending-usddeso.md](validate-by-buying-or-sending-usddeso.md "mention")
   * transfer $DESO from an exchange like Coinbase, or another DeSo wallet, to verify your account anonymously
   * you can choose to validate with ID from the homepage if you choose to proceed with this method
