| Seed Phrase | <p>A series of words generated by your cryptocurrency wallet that give you access to the crypto associated with that wallet. Think of a wallet as being similar to a password manager for crypto, and the seed phrase as being the master password. As long as you have your seed phrase, you’ll have access to all of the crypto associated with the wallet that generated the phrase.<br></p>                                          |
| Wallet      | Crypto wallets store your private keys, keeping your crypto safe and accessible. They also allow you to send, receive, and spend cryptocurrencies like $DESO.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Passphrase  | A string of text or sequence of words or other text used to control access to your crypto wallet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Public Key  | A public key allows you to receive cryptocurrency transactions. It’s a cryptographic code that’s paired with a private key. While anyone can send transactions to the public key, you need the private key to “unlock” them and prove that you are the owner of the cryptocurrency received in the transaction. The public key that can receive transactions is usually an address, which is simply a shortened form of your public key. |
| KYC         | KYC (short for "know your customer") is the process of verifying a customer's identity. It's common with financial institutions and financial service businesses, including cryptocurrency wallets and exchanges. KYC is used to confirm that a customer is who they claim to be and to prevent illegal activities.                                                                                                                      |
| Fork        | Cryptocurrencies like DeSo are powered by decentralized, open-source software called a blockchain. A fork happens whenever a community makes a change to the blockchain’s protocol, or basic set of rules.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
