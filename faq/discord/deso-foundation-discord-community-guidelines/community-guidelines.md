# Community Guidelines

## Shilling&#x20;

* Sharing external links to projects with little or no context within a conversation between another community member&#x20;
* â€œNative Shilling" - bots create new discord users who start brief conversations about projects (tokens, NFTs, etc.) that appear to be organic (mods can decipher this type of shilling by checking the lifetime of the account and whether the username contributes to other channels regularly)
* Community members are welcome to share his/her project, with the intention to find partners or gather feedback, in the #projects-collabs channel&#x20;

## Warnings Users&#x20;

* Users who partake in [#shilling](community-guidelines.md#shilling "mention") tokens, NFTs, or other projects should be immediately warned by a moderator
* After warning a user, moderators should report the incident in the #moderator-only channel&#x20;
  * As the size of the Server grows, we may request moderators post the report to a separate discord channel, or complete a form/sheet entry&#x20;
* If a user receives more than 2 warnings, he/she should be banned from the server&#x20;

## Banning Users&#x20;

* Users who engage in unsolicited direct DMs regarding wallets and transferring money, as well as obvious imposters, should be immediately banned
* Banning for other reasons should be brought to the Community team in the #moderator-only channel&#x20;
  * If the circumstance is controversial, please seek input from a member of the Foundation Community Team&#x20;
* Under most circumstances, if a user receives more than 2 warnings, he/she should be banned from the server
* After banning a user, moderators should report the incident here and inform the #moderator-only channel

## Deleting Content&#x20;

* Inappropriate, degrading, or personal attacks should be deleted immediately&#x20;
* Offensive emojis, stickers, memes, or gifs should be deleted immediately&#x20;
* Content that could be considered [#shilling](community-guidelines.md#shilling "mention") should be deleted immediately&#x20;
* If you have questions or concerns regarding content deletion, please reach out to #moderator-only for additional input
