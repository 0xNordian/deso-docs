# Referral Program - Overview

The DeSo referral program allows users to share their unique referral link with a friend who has yet to join the platform.&#x20;

The DeSo Foundation rewards the [Advocate](referral-program-glossary.md) and [Friend](referral-program-glossary.md) through a dual-sided incentive program, which differs by KYC country. A full list can be found [here](referral-program-incentive-structure.md).

Users are not granted a referral link upon signup. Issuing referral links is typically done manually and in batches.

Our [referral incentives](referral-program-glossary.md) are accurate as of when the advocate sends an invite to a friend. However, our referral amounts are subject to change, so we recommend the friend signs up immediately after receiving the referral link.

After opening the referral link, the user will be prompted to verify their identity via Jumio. Upon successful verification, the referred friend and advocate are granted the referral incentive based on the incentive structure outlined [here](referral-program-incentive-structure.md).&#x20;

Some referral links are capped to a maximum number of referred friends. This information can be viewed by logging into [Diamond](https://diamondapp.com), navigating to `Referrals`, and viewing `Referrals remaining` under `My Referrals`.

_The referral program incentive amounts and structure are subject to change at any time._
